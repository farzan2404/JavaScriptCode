<!-- Variable hoisting:

When a variable is declared using the var keyword, 
the declaration is hoisted to the top of its scope, but not the initialization. 
This means that the variable is recognized throughout the scope even before its actual declaration in the code. 
However, the assignment or initialization of the variable remains in its original position. -->
