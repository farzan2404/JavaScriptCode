    <h1> Llamas </h1>
    <p> The llama (/ˈlɑːmə/; Spanish pronunciation: [ˈʎama]) (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, 
        widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era.
        Llamas are social animals and live with others as a herd. Their wool is soft and contains only a small amount of lanolin.
        [2] Llamas can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions.
        When using a pack, they can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km (5–8 miles).
        [3] The name llama (in the past also spelled "lama" or "glama") was adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians.</p>
